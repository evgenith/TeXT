These templates are not meant to teach the use of basic LaTeX markup
such as \section, \begin{definition}, etc. Instead, they contain all
the preamble magic needed to instantly start writing a certain
document type.

To use one of these templates, take a copy, put your content inside,
and compile it.

All the packages needed for full functionality are free software,
usually LPPL (http://www.latex-project.org/lppl/), and are availible
on CTAN. The full version of TeX Live (package texlive-full on ubuntu)
is sufficient.

This is experimental software meant for advanced users; assume nothing
works, and you may be pleasantly surprised. And when it breaks, you
get to keep both pieces.
